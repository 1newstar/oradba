<H1>Overview</H1>

Having worked as an Oracle DBA since the mid-1990s I have accumulated numerous example scripts for db creation, health checks, package installation, troubleshooting etc. I have brought them together into this gitlab repository to support my DBA training courses and make them available for the wider community to use as they desire. 

As of Sep 2017 many are used 'in anger' in production against  Oracle 11.2 databases and have been unit tested for basic functionality against a sample Oracle 12.2 installation. 

To re-emphasise the generic copyright and "as is" comments above I strongly recommend you test any of this functionality before using in a production environment. Oracle continually introduces new functionality, tweaks parameters from release to release. Your environment may have different options installed, run on a different flavour of Linux or Windows which could give unexpected results. However even with that warning in place, most functionality here has worked with only minor tweaks since at least Oracle 9 and on both Linux and Windows environments. 

I hope you fined these useful and I welcome feedback.
